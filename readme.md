# DevCon REST TDD Demo

This repository contains the code I wrote for my Luminis DevCon 2018 presentation on [Test-Driven Documentation for your REST(ful) service](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NT_Wql8wMg).

The project contains a Spring Boot based Hypermedia API for Starwars resources, which gets documented by using [Spring REST Docs](https://projects.spring.io/spring-restdocs/).

There are 2 branches worth looking at:

- master (contains a fully documented version of the API)
- auto-restdocs (leverages [Spring Auto REST Docs](https://github.com/ScaCap/spring-auto-restdocs) for generating API docs)
